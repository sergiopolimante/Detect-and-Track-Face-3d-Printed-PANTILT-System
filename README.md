This project is part of the Robotics Engineering course at UFABC.
The goal of the system is to detect and follow faces in its field of view.

The links (white pieces) that connect the motors and camera were designed using SOLIDWORKS and printed using a 3DCloner. 

The system was designed to be as cheap as possible, so the motors chosen were the TowerPro SG90, the simplest and cheapest on the market. Arduino was used to receive information from the computer and control the motors.

The face-detection algorithm was programed using OpenCV and Python. I want to give special thanks to this tutorial that taught me everything I needed:

The control of the system was also implemented in python. 

This repository contains:
  -All codes for Arduino and Python
  -All the SOLIDWORK files of the pieces used
